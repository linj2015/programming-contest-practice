Problem statement: https://uva.onlinejudge.org/external/7/759.pdf

What I learned: When the solution gets complex and tedious, always start
thinking ways to approach the problem differently. For this problem, rather
than trying to code all of the rules for a valid Roman numeral, convert the
given Roman numeral into decimal form, then back to Roman numeral, and finally
check if it matches the given Roman numeral.
