# Programming Contest Practice

~~Before I come up with a better description for this repository, this will
be it: I just decided to solve some practice problems from past programming
contests.~~  
Ranked top 9 for USC Programming Contest (2018 Fall), and now preparing for
[ICPC SoCal Regional](http://socalcontest.org/current/index.shtml 
"SoCal Region ICPC") that is in 4 days!

I also find it interesting how literally each coach uses different online judge
websites.

Language: C++  

## Problems 
See sub-folders for notes and solution write-ups (for those that I found
particularly interesting). 

### Sphere Online Judge
- __Inside or Outside__: determine if a point is inside a polygon

### UVa Online Judge
- __Error Correction__: parity property
- __Goldbach's Conjecture__: sum of prime numbers
- __Caesar Cypher__: encryption/decryption
- __Just the Facts__: finding last non-zero digit of a factorial
- __Heads__: number conversion to scientific notation using log
- __Bridge Hands__: deal and sort cards
- __Oil Deposits__: BFS
- __LC Display__: output digits like LC display 
- __Adding Reversed Numbers__: add numbers up to 200 digits
- __487--3279__: find duplicates
- __The Return of the Roman Empire__: Roman numeral validation
- __Monkeys in a Regular Forest__: BFS
- __Ananagrams__: given a dictionary, find words that are not anagrams
- __String Computer__: DP edit distance

### USC Programming Contest (2018 Spring)
- __Tide Pods__: basic finding maximum difference
- __Non-Violent Protests__: basic counting

### Roche Code4Life
- __Problem Statement__: "The goal of the puzzle is to control a laboratory
robot during all stages of medicines creation. To win the game, you should be
faster than your colleagues."
- __My Algorithm__: Always select the sample with the highest health-to-cost
ratio by sorting the vector with a custom comparator.
- __Progress__: Passed the first division.
