# Programming Contest Practice

Before I come up with a better description for this repository, this will be
it: I just decided to solve some practice problems from past programming
contests.  

Language: C++  

## Problems 
### USC Programming Contest 2018 spring 
- __Tide Pods__: basic finding maximum difference
- __Non-Violent Protests__: basic counting

### Roche Code4Life
- __Problem Statement__: "The goal of the puzzle is to control a laboratory
robot during all stages of medicines creation. To win the game, you should be
faster than your colleagues."
- __My Algorithm__: Always select the sample with the highest health-to-cost
ratio by sorting the vector with a custom comparator.
- __Progress__: Passed the first division.
